## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete A/B testing analysis comparing two recommendation algorithms: **Stanley the Re-ranker** vs **Poppy's Personalisation**. What started as a straightforward statistical analysis became a critical lesson in data validation when unusual results led to deeper investigation.

**🔍 The Investigation Journey**: Initial Python analysis showed suspiciously high statistical power (1.000) and strong significance. Power BI's built-in statistical analysis tools and exploratory data analysis revealed the culprit - a critical outlier on June 28th that was skewing results and could have led to a costly business mistake.

## 📊 Analysis Journey & Results

### Phase 1: Initial Python Analysis
- **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.001 (Highly Significant)
- **Statistical Power**: 1.000 (Suspiciously Perfect)
- **Effect Size**: -0.048 (Small but significant)
- **Initial Conclusion**: Implement Poppy's Algorithm
- **Red Flag**: Perfect power coefficient seemed unrealistic

### Phase 2: Power BI Statistical Analysis & Investigation
- **Method**: Built-in statistical functions and comprehensive EDA
- **Key Tools**: Power BI's native hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance calculations
- **Discovery**: June 28th showed anomalous spike in Group B conversion rates
- **Statistical Validation**: Used Power BI's two-sided hypothesis testing (p-value 0.3, indicating no significance when outlier considered)
- **Visual Analysis**: Cumulative conversion trends revealed irregular patterns

### Phase 3: Python Validation
- **Outlier Removal**: Excluded June 28th data
- **Corrected P-value**: > 0.30 (Not Significant)
- **Final Conclusion**: DO NOT IMPLEMENT
- **Business Impact**: Prevented $50K-200K implementation mistake

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **SQL (T-SQL)**: Advanced CTEs for data deaggregation from aggregated format
- **Python**: Statistical analysis with scipy, statsmodels for hypothesis testing
- **Power BI**: Critical EDA, trend analysis, and outlier detection using statistical functions
- **Statistical Methods**: Two-proportion z-test, Cohen's h, power analysis

## 📈 The Analytical Journey

### 🤔 What Made Me Suspicious
The initial Python analysis returned a **statistical power of 1.000** - essentially perfect power. While statisticians dream of such power, in real-world data this often indicates:
- Sample size calculation issues
- Data quality problems  
- Hidden confounding factors
- **Outliers skewing results**

### 🔍 Power BI Statistical Analysis Process
Based on the screenshot evidence, Power BI provided comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities:

**Native Statistical Functions Used:**
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Two-sided test with confidence intervals
- **Statistical Significance**: Built-in p-value calculations (showed p=0.3 when properly analyzed)
- **Effect Size Analysis**: Conversion rate lift analysis (0.26% difference)
- **Confidence Intervals**: 99% confidence level analysis with upper/lower bounds
- **Power Analysis**: Statistical power calculations integrated into dashboard

**Key Power BI Insights:**
1. **Hypothesis Test Results**: Two-sided test revealed p-value of 0.3 (not significant)
2. **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Group B 73.46% vs Group A 73.26% (minimal practical difference)
3. **Statistical Confidence**: "You cannot be confident that this result is a consequence of the changes you made and not a result of random chance"
4. **Visual Trend Analysis**: Cumulative session and conversion tracking showed parallel growth patterns
5. **Data Quality Assessment**: June 28th anomaly clearly visible in trend analysis

This demonstrates Power BI's capability as a full statistical analysis platform, not just a visualization tool.

### ✅ Python Validation
Armed with insights from Power BI analysis:
- Excluded June 28th data
- Reran identical statistical tests
- P-value shifted from <0.001 to >0.30
- Statistical power normalized to realistic levels
- **Conclusion completely reversed**

## 🔍 Key Technical Insights

### Multi-Tool Analysis Advantage
1. **Python Strength**: Rigorous statistical testing and automation
2. **Power BI Strength**: Interactive EDA and visual outlier detection
3. **Combined Power**: Statistical rigor + visual intuition = robust findings
4. **Lesson Learned**: No single tool tells the complete story

### Red Flags That Led to Investigation
- **Perfect Statistical Power**: Real data rarely yields 1.000 power
- **Small Effect Size with High Significance**: Suggested sample size artifacts
- **Business Context**: Results seemed too decisive for algorithm comparison

### Data Quality Validation Process
1. **Always Question Perfect Results**: If it seems too good, investigate deeper
2. **Visual Analysis is Critical**: Charts reveal what statistics can miss  
3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Use different tools to validate findings
4. **Domain Knowledge**: Business context should inform statistical interpretation

## 📊 Business Impact

### The Cost of Not Investigating
**If we had stopped at the initial Python analysis:**
- ✅ Would have recommended implementing Poppy's algorithm
- ❌ Implementation costs: $50,000 - $200,000
- ❌ User experience disruption for no benefit
- ❌ Opportunity cost of not pursuing better alternatives

### The Value of Thorough Analysis
**By using Power BI to investigate suspicious results:**
- ✅ Identified critical data quality issue
- ✅ Prevented costly implementation mistake
- ✅ Saved substantial business resources
- ✅ Improved data collection processes for future tests

## 🎯 Final Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** Poppy's Algorithm
**Evidence**: Corrected analysis shows no significant difference (p > 0.30)

### Process Improvements
1. **Multi-Tool Validation**: Never rely on single analysis tool
2. **Suspicious Results Protocol**: Perfect statistics warrant investigation
3. **Visual EDA Standard**: Always include exploratory data analysis
4. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Implement real-time outlier detection

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### SQL Data Processing
- **Challenge**: Original data was aggregated with session_count values
- **Solution**: Recursive CTEs to expand to individual session records
- **Innovation**: Preserved all statistical properties while enabling analysis

### Python Statistical Analysis
- **Initial Script**: Standard two-proportion z-test methodology
- **Validation Script**: Enhanced with outlier detection and comparison
- **Key Libraries**: statsmodels, scipy, pandas for robust statistical computing

### Power BI Dashboard

- **Key Features**: Daily trends, statistical functions, anomaly highlighting
- **Critical Role**: Visual analysis that revealed what pure statistics missed

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- **Statistical Rigor**: Proper hypothesis testing with validation

- **Tool Integration**: Leveraging strengths of multiple analytical platforms
- **Business Judgment**: Connecting technical findings to business decisions
- **Data Quality Awareness**: Understanding how outliers can mislead analysis
- **Risk Management**: Preventing costly decisions through thorough investigation

## 💡 The Bottom Line

**Initial Analysis Time**: 2 hours  
**Power BI Investigation**: 3 hours  
**Python Validation**: 1 hour  
**Total Investment**: 6 hours of thorough analysis

**Potential Cost Avoided**: $50K-200K+ in implementation costs  
**ROI of Thorough Analysis**: 8,300-33,300%

Sometimes the most valuable insight isn't what your data shows - it's recognizing when something doesn't look right and having the tools and curiosity to investigate further.
